In the process of uncovering the topics of persistence of vision, the magic of invisible ink and visual treat of how different solutions with different pH levels react in the presence of an indicator this Sunday the kids at the Good Life Centre Tambaram were treated to the first MAD Lab session of the year, not only for the centre but for MAD Chennai as a whole.

The kids ( 18 boys and 13 girls) witnessed a one and half hour session involving these three experiments. The sessions were held separately for the boys and the girls and ran in parallel that afternoon. The kids were grouped in pairs with two volunteers (one being a new recruit) mapped to each pair.

The enthusiasm with which the kids and the volunteers participated was more than overwhelming.

To document their understanding each of them was given worksheet to fill out the apparatus used and their observations of each experiment. Some of the kids volunteered to read out what they had written at the end of each experiment. 

The session was without doubt a huge success and a curtain raiser for all the other projects coming up this year.
