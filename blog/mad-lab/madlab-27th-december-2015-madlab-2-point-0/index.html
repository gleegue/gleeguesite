<section>
<p>With Chennai returning to normalcy after the torrential rains, so too were our schedules. On the 27th of December, 2015 came the much-awaited MAD Lab 2.0 at the Good Life Centre, Tambaram. Looking to make it bigger and better than the last time, that’s exactly what we did! :D</p>
<p><img alt="setting-things-up" src="/static/img/MadLab2_0_pic1.jpg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Setting up the Madlab session</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast to the previous MAD Lab where the boys and girls had parallel but separate sessions, we had them all together in one boisterous room. The session started off with an experiment to get the kids to ‘see’ sound (in a plate of water) through it’s vibration. This was my first experience with the GL kids and it was quite the ordeal given how noisy they were :p Fortunately for me, Vasu saved the day by grabbing the kids attention with a timely interception. We managed to go through with the experiment and the resulting looks on the kids’ faces were absolute GOLD! They were awestruck by how sound could make shimmying patterns on the surface of the water. They couldn’t seem to get enough and had us re-run the experiment a couple of times before scribbling down what they had learnt on their worksheets.</p>

<p>See the sound experiment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next up was Sri Krishnan with his home-made fire extinguisher. A simple concoction of baking soda, vinegar and water conjured up an effective extinguisher. The kids were taught the concepts of how oxygen and carbon-dioxide, respectively, help and hinder a burning fire. They didn’t need too much cajoling to pay attention, as the magic of a chemical reaction had their eyes glued to SK’s ‘witchcraft’ :p </p>
<p>The kids were starting to get a bit restless, so we had our Dr. Amma :p (Shreya) teach the kids how to check their pulses on the wrist. A fifteen second count of the beats times four gave the kids an idea of their heartrates. They seemed to enjoy this activity and I’m pretty sure they were glad to learn something new.</p>
<p>Toptap took over with a brilliant microscope that he’d made himself. His ingenious idea merely needed a phone’s camera as an eyepiece, while the lens took care of the magnification. An onion, salt and fabric were the samples subjected to magnification. As ever, the microscope was a massive hit with the kids as they were awed at how something so splendid could be done with a little effort.</p>

<p>To wrap things up, Vasu used three different sized syringes and a tube to demonstrate the concept of mechanical advantage. Having stuck the three syringes on a scaled chart, he attached another syringe to a tube and filled it up with water. One by one, he connected a syringe on the chart to the tube and illustrated the concept. Most kids were familiar with this phenomenon, but the younger ones were intrigued by what they’d just seen. </p>
<p>The worksheets were all filled up by the end of the session and some of the responses documented were so detailed, they surprised us. Overall, it was a successful and MADtastic session for both the volunteers and kids, with enjoyment all around :D Looking forward to even more MADness in the sessions to come. STAY MAD,  PEEPALS!!!!</p>
